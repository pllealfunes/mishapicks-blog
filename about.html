            <p id="aboutPara1">Hello my fellow felines...and nosy humans...I'm Misha! Welcome to my amazing blog that
                showcases my
                busy and beautiful life. You can find all my favorite things and as well as my life the humans that I
                adopted.</p>
            <p id="aboutPara2">To give you some background about me, I was born in the forest next to my current home,
                and at 2 months old I found my current humans. On the day we met the weather was awful because of a
                hurricane
                was passing by and I was scared.
                When the weather got better I saw the humans leave the house and come toward me. They tried speaking cat
                but instead they said a whole bunch of gibberish. They seemed friendly and they had food, so I decided
                it was best to go with them. In the beginning our relationship was quite odd because they have never had
                a cat. They didn't know how amazing cats are and everything that I did left them in wonder. Now after 10
                years I've come to love them even though they still get on my nerves sometimes. </p>
            <p id="aboutPara3">Anyway, I hope you guys enjoy my blog and follow me on social media. Thanks!</p>
