            <p>It's that time of the year where the grass gets greener, the sun shines, and the chipmunks come out to
                play. Not only am I freed from this stuffy house, but I also don't need to stand next to the heat as
                much! The days may still be a little bit chilly but the days are so much more refreshing and
                aesthetically pleasing. Now that Spring is here I need to start training again so that I can catch
                Chippy Chipmunk and bring him home to play. Last year, I was able to bring him home to play multiple
                times, but my humans never really let him stay long. I don't know why he's so fun and I don't mind
                playing altogether. My humans have a hard time catching Chippy so they just create barriers and lead him
                outside. I have honestly tried many times to teach them how to hunt but they refuse to listen to me.</p>
            <p>To keep in shape to get ready for chipmunk season I make sure I sleep through half of
                Winter and once Spring hits I start my official training. For my training, I like to sneak up on the
                humans, chase the humans, and attack the humans when they are least expecting it. I also like to run
                extra laps around the sun during my 5 a.m run. Stretching is also important because you don't want
                to
                hurt yourself or pull a muscle.</p>
            <p>How do you prepare for Spring? Have any fun hunting stories? Let me know in the
                comment section and don't forget to follow me on social media!</p>

            <h3 class="blogTitle">My Birthday</h3>

            <div>3-27-2020</div>
            <p>Today is my birthday. I am not 100% sure if that is true, but the humans have told me that for the past
                10 years and I like being the center of attention. At 5 am when I sing to one of my humans to feed me,
                they did not wish me a happy birthday. I let this pass because humans are incapable to follow my
                sleeping patterns and they forget everything. At 10 am when I walk into the kitchen my humans give me
                extra love and attention, and wish me a happy birthday. Unfortunately, the weather was still chilly and
                my humans did not allow me to take a stroll in the front yard. I wish my birthday had better weather so
                that I can go out, catch my favorite chipmunk (Chippy), and bask in the glory of the birthday hunt.</p>
            <p>I did find it quite odd that the humans did not have my party-ready when I woke up
                at 5 pm. I decided to go back to sleep as I was upset at the thought that they did not sing to me.
                Seriously
                though...THEY DO IT EVERY YEAR AND THIS YEAR THEY DIDN'T?!?!?... As I was sleeping in my drawer I
                heard
                from
                far away the humans calling my name and when I walk in the kitchen they started singing and there
                was a
                banner! They did care! They even made me my fish-shaped cake! Today was such a great 10th birthday
                that
                I got to spend with my humans!</p>

            <h3 class="blogTitle">My Morning Routine</h3>
            <p> <img alt="Misha standing on the chair" src="images/misha-morning.jpg" id="misha-morning">
            <div>4-19-2020</div>
            <p>Hey, felines! I thought today I would share my morning routine! My morning officially starts at 5 a.m and
                I'm already feeling a little hungry at this time. I head to one of the human's room and oh so gently ask
                (multiple times) one of my humans to feed me. I don't know about you guys but humans do not do well at 5
                a.m. They for some reason prefer to sleep at this time and it's one of the best times to be awake! I
                mean I love running around the house early in the morning and playing with my squeaky mice. Humans are
                all groggy and they get upset when I try to invite them to play "Knock the Stuff off The Table". Anyway,
                after eating, I play a little and I walk the house to make sure everything is safe and perfect. I
                eventually start to feel tired and head to my favorite drawer to sleep. At 9 a.m one of the humans wakes
                up and I get up as well. I lead them to the kitchen to have them open the curtain for me so that I can
                see outside, give me more food, clean water, and give me attention. I spend the rest of the morning
                rolling around in the living room, looking outside, and watching my humans cook their food.
            </p>
            <p>Also, if the weather is nice my humans let me go outside for a while! I love
                looking for chipmunks, rabbits, scratching trees, rolling around in the dirt, and sunbathing. I also
                love watching the neighbors work in their gardens. It's so pretty but my humans don't let me go play
                there...but I will one day!</p>

                have any ideas to wake a human up at 5 a.m let me know! Till next time!</p>
